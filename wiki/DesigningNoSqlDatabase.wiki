This page illustrates a good solution on how to design a simple Blog application the 'NoSQL' way. Some of the techniques listed on this page can be applied in other NoSQL variants.

= Introduction =

Oren from the popular .NET blog http://ayende.com/Blog/, is putting together a [http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/04/20/that-no-sql-thing-the-relational-modeling-anti-pattern-in.aspx series of blogs] explaining how to approach designing a simple blog application using a NoSQL database. Although he's using his RavenDB as a reference implementation, this example applies equally well to Redis and other NoSQL variants.

Where possible I will show how you can use the advanced features in Redis and the [ServiceStackRedis C# Redis Client] to provide simple, fast and effective solutions. The entire source code for this example is available at [http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/source/browse/trunk/Common/ServiceStack.Redis/ServiceStack.Redis.Tests/Examples/BlogPostExample.cs BlogPostExample.cs]

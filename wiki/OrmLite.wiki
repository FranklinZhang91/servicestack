A convention-based, configuration-free lightweight ORM that uses the standard POCO classes and Data Annotation attributes to infer its table schema.

= Introduction =

OrmLite is a set of light-weight extension methods around System.Data.`*` interfaces which is designed to persist POCO classes with a minimal amount of intrusion and configuration.
Another Orm with similar goals is [http://code.google.com/p/sqlite-net/ sqlite-net].

OrmLite was designed with a focus on these core objectives:
  * Simplicity - with minimal, convention-based attribute configuration
  * High performance - with support for indexes, text blobs, etc.
  * Expressive power and flexibility - with access to IDbCommand and raw SQL
  * Cross platform - supports multiple dbs (currently: Sqlite and SqlServer) on both .NET and Mono platforms.

= Limitations =
For simplicity and to be able to have the same POCO model persisted in RDBMS, db4o, memcached, redis, on the filesystem, etc (ServiceStack supports all of these options), each model must have a property named 'Id' which is its primary key.

Latest release notes for the latest version of the c# [ServiceStackRedis ServiceStack.Redis client].

= Redis Client v1.08 Release Notes =

=== API compatibility ===
This version of the client includes support for the *Redis 1.3.7 API*. This includes support for all Sorted Sets and Hash operations.

=== Features ===
  * Included in the release is preliminary support for Transient Redis Message Queues.
  * Thread-safe load balanced `PooledRedisClientManager` and `BasicRedisClientManager` client managers, suitable to drop in any IOC.
      * Supports configuration of multiple read-write masters and read-only slave Redis server instances.

=== Breaking API changes: ===
  * Due to a change in the Redis 1.3.7 KEYS operation, `IRedisClient.AllKeys` and `IRedisClient.GetKeys()` now return a `List<string>`.

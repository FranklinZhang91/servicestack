= Open Source .NET/C# Client for Redis =

[http://code.google.com/p/redis/ Redis] is one of the fastest and feature-rich key-value stores to come from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL NoSQL] movement. It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can either be strings lists, sets, or ordered sets.

[ServiceStackRedis ServiceStack.Redis] is an Open Source C# Redis client based on [http://twitter.com/migueldeicaza Miguel de Icaza] previous efforts with [http://github.com/migueldeicaza/redis-sharp redis-sharp]. 

The client gives you a choice 3 different API's to use based on your preference:
  * [IRedisNativeClient] - Allows raw byte access to the Redis APIs
  * [IRedisClient] - Provides a friendlier, more descriptive API that lets you store values as strings (UTF8 encoding).
  * [IRedisGenericClient] - Same as [IRedisClient] API except it lets you store values of any type (e.g. C# POCO objects)


= Download =

The latest version of the Redis client is included as part of [http://servicestack.googlecode.com/files/ServiceStack.zip ServiceStack.zip]

Alternatively it is available as a separate standalone  [http://servicestack.googlecode.com/files/ServiceStack.Redis.dll ServiceStack.Redis.dll]

The full source code for the client and the examples is available to [http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Common/ServiceStack.Redis view online]

Below is a simple example to give you a flavour of how easy it is to store rich data in Redis:

== Speed ==
One of the best things about Redis is the speed - it is quick. 

[http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/source/browse/trunk/Common/ServiceStack.Redis/ServiceStack.Redis.Tests/Generic/RedisClientTests.cs This example] below stores and gets the entire [http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/source/browse/trunk/Common/Northwind.Benchmarks/Northwind.Common/DataModel/NorthwindData.cs Northwind database] (3202 records) in less *1.2 secs*.

_(Running inside a VS.NET/R# unit test on a 3 year old iMac)_

{{{
using (var client = new RedisClient())
{
	var before = DateTime.Now;
	client.StoreAll(NorthwindData.Categories);
	client.StoreAll(NorthwindData.Customers);

	client.StoreAll(NorthwindData.Shippers);

	client.StoreAll(NorthwindData.EmployeeTerritories);

	Console.WriteLine("Took {0}ms to store the entire Northwind database ({1} records)",

Note: The total time taken includes an extra operation for each record to store the id of the type id in a Redis set for each set as well as serializing and de-serializing each record using Service Stack's TypeSerializer.
